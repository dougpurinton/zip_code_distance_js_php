
WARNING!!! MOST IMPORT: Seriously...
Both Apache and PHP must be either 32 or 64 bit. NO MIXING!

Download the following:

Apache (latest stable version)
https://www.apachelounge.com/download/

Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio (VC version must match apachelounge version)
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145

PHP (Thread Safe)
http://windows.php.net/download/

Do the following:

Install Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio.

Copy Apache folder to "C:/" (ex. "C:/Apache24")
(When you unzip to an other location, change ServerRoot in the httpd.conf,
  and change in httpd.conf the Documenroot, Directories, ScriptAlias,
  also when you use the extra folder config file(s) change to your location there. )

Copy PHP folder to "C:/PHP" (ex. "C:/PHP/php_7.0.10")

Go to Control Panel > System > Advanced system settings
Under the tab "Advanced", click on "Environment Variables..."
Under "System variables", select "Path" and click "Edit"
In the text field "Variable value:" append the following 3 directories...

C:\Apache24
C:\Apache24\bin
C:\PHP\php_7.0.10

(The following commands can be found in "ReadMe.txt", that's inside the Apache httpd zip file.)
Open CMD (command prompt) as Administrator and enter...

httpd.exe -k install

(Note: The following lines that need to be appended can be found in file "C:/PHP/php_7.0.10/install.txt" - line 658 for version 7.0.10,
make sure you see a line in this section that reads "Example 2-6. PHP and Apache 2.0 as Module" so you know you're in the right section!
You can also search for this in this file by searching "apache module")

Open "C:/Apache24/conf/httpd.conf"
At the very bottom of this file, append the following 3 lines...
(Note: Actually LOOK in the "C:/PHP/php_7.0.10" folder you created earlier to verify that the file name is exactly correct!)

LoadModule php7_module "C:/PHP/php_7.0.10/php7apache2_4.dll"
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
PHPIniDir "C:/PHP/php_7.0.10"

With this file ("httpd.conf") still open, search for "DirectoryIndex"
(For Apache 2.4.x, the line in question should be on or around line 278)
Change "DirectoryIndex index.html" to...

DirectoryIndex index.php

Next, search for "ServerName" (line 220)
Uncomment "#ServerName www.example.com:80" and change it to...

ServerName localhost:8080

Search for "Listen" and find "Listen 80" (line 58) and replace it with...

Listen 8080

Search for "AllowOverride" and replace "AllowOverride none" (line 228) with...
AllowOverride All

Next, SAVE this file ("httpd.conf")

Make a copy of "C:/PHP/php_7.0.10/php.ini-development" and rename that COPY to "php.ini" in the same folder.
Open the newly created "php.ini" file and search for "extension_dir"
Uncomment the line (on line 724 for version 7.0.10)...

extension_dir = "ext"

Search for "ssl" and uncomment the following line
;extension=php_openssl.dll	(line 880)

Search for "mysql" and uncomment the following lines
;extension=php_mysqli.dll	(line 878)
;extension=php_pdo_mysql.dll	(line 882)
;extension=php_pdo_pgsql.dll	(line 885)
;extension=php_pgsql.dll	(line 887)

Next, SAVE this file ("php.ini")

Next, create a new file called "C:/Apache24/htdocs/info.php" and open it
Copy and paste the 3 lines below in this file...

<?PHP
phpinfo();
?>

Next, SAVE this file("info.php")
That's it!!! DONE!
Restart your computer, open the Apache Service Monitor ("C:/Apache24/bin/ApacheMonitor.exe") and START it
then, open up your favorite web browser and navigate to "http://localhost:8080/info.php"
If you see all of the PHP information and no errors, you are all set up for testing web sites and PHP!!!!!!!
